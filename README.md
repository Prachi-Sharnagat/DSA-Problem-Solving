# 🧠 DSA Problems

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms** playground!  
This repository contains all the DSA problems I solve as part of my journey to mastering problem-solving.

## 📝 Problem-Solving Pattern (Consistent Across All Problems)

For **every problem**, I follow the **same structured pattern**:

- 📍 **Platform** (LeetCode / GFG)
- 🔢 **Problem name & number**
- 🔗 **Problem link**
- 🧠 **Brute Force approach**
- ⚡ **Optimal approach**
- ⏱ **Time complexity**
- 💾 **Space complexity**

👉 The **optimal solution** is submitted on platforms  
👉 **Both brute force and optimal solutions** are written and maintained here for learning and interview preparation
